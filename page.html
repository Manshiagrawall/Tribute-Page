                    Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic ofMacedonia. Little is known about her early life, but at a young age, she felt a callingto be a nun and serve through helping the poor. At the age of 18, she was givenpermission to join a group of nuns in Ireland. After a few months of training, withthe Sisters of Loreto, she was then given permission to travel to India. She took herformal religious vows in 1931 and chose to be named after St Therese of Lisieux 
                    -the patron saint of missionaries.

                <p>On her arrival in India, she began by working as a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta made a deep  impression on her, and this led to her starting a new order called “The Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective of this mission was to look after people, who nobody else was prepared to look after.Mother Teresa felt that serving others was a fundamental principle of the teachingsof Jesus Christ. She often mentioned the saying of Jesus,
                    
                    “Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do it to me.”
                      As Mother Teresa said herself:
                </p>
            
                <p>“Love cannot remain by itself -
                    it has no meaning. Love has to be put intoaction, and that action is service
                   .”

                            - Mother TeresaShe experienced two particularly traumatic periods in Calcutta. The first wasthe Bengal famine of 1943 and the second was the Hindu/Muslim violence in 1946, before the partition of India. In 1948, she left the convent to live full-time amongthe poorest of Calcutta. She chose to wear a white Indian sari, with a blue border, out of respect for the traditional Indian dress. For many years, Mother Teresa and a small band of fellow nuns survived on minimal income and food,often having to beg for funds. But, slowly her efforts with the poorest were notedand appreciated by the local community and Indian politicians.In 1952, she opened her first home for the dying, which allowed people todie with dignity. Mother Teresa often spent time with those who were dying. Somehave criticised the lack of proper medical attention, and their refusal to givepainkillers. Others say that it afforded many neglected people the opportunity todie knowing that someone cared.Her work spread around the world. By 2013, there were 700 missionsoperating in over 130 countries. The scope of their work also expanded to includeorphanages and hospices for those with terminal illnesses.

                    - Mother TeresaMother Teresa never sought to convert those of another faith. Those in herhospices were given the religious rites appropriate to their faith. However, she hada very firm Catholic faith and took a strict line on abortion, the death penalty anddivorce even if her position was unpopular. Her whole life was influenced by her
                    faith and religion, even though at times she confessed she didn't feel the presence of God.The Missionaries of Charity now has branches throughout the worldincluding branches in the developed world where they work with the homeless andpeople affected by AIDS. In 1965, the organization became an InternationalReligious Family by a decree of Pope Paul VI.In the 1960s, the life of Mother Teresa was brought to a wider publicattention by Malcolm Muggeridge who wrote a book and produced a documentary called “Something Beautiful for God”.

                    In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distres which also constitutes a threat to peace.” She didn't attend the ceremonial banquet but asked that the $192,000 fund be given to the poor.In later years, she was more active in western developed countries. Shecommented that though the West materially prosperous, there was often aspiritual poverty.

                            On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith." Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become Mother Teresa".

                            She began missionary work with the poor in 1948, replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums. She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry. At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".
